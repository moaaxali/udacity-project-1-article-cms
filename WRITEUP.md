# Overview of Azure compute services
Azure compute is an on-demand computing service for running cloud-based applications.

- Azure Virtual Machines
- Azure App Services

## Azure Virtual Machine
Virtual machines are software emulations of physical computers. They include a virtual processor, memory, storage, and networking resources. VMs host an operating system, and we can install and run software just like a physical computer. When using a remote desktop client, we can use and control the VM as if we were sitting in front of it.

With Azure Virtual Machines, we can create and use VMs in the cloud. VMs provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS) in the form of a virtualized server and can be used in many ways. Just like a physical computer, we can customize all of the software running on the VM. VMs are an ideal choice when we need:

- Total control over the operating system (OS).
- The ability to run custom software.
- To use custom hosting configurations.
