# Overview of Azure compute services
Azure compute is an on-demand computing service for running cloud-based applications.

- Azure Virtual Machines
- Azure App Services

## Azure Virtual Machine
Virtual machines are software emulations of physical computers. They include a virtual processor, memory, storage, and networking resources. VMs host an operating system, and we can install and run software just like a physical computer. When using a remote desktop client, we can use and control the VM as if we were sitting in front of it.

With Azure Virtual Machines, we can create and use VMs in the cloud. VMs provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS) in the form of a virtualized server and can be used in many ways. Just like a physical computer, we can customize all of the software running on the VM. VMs are an ideal choice when we need:

- Total control over the operating system (OS).
- The ability to run custom software.
- To use custom hosting configurations.

## Azure App Services
With Azure App Service, we can quickly build, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade web, mobile, and API apps running on any platform. We can meet rigorous performance, scalability, security, and compliance requirements while using a fully managed platform to perform infrastructure maintenance. App Service is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering.

App Service enables us to build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. It offers automatic scaling and high availability. App Service supports Windows and Linux and enables automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo to support a continuous deployment model.

It allows us to focus on the website and API logic while Azure handles the infrastructure to run and scale our web applications.
